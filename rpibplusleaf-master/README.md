# Raspberry Pi B+ Pinout Leaf

Inspired by the original [Rasperry Leaf](http://www.raspberrypi.org/raspberry-leaf/) but for the 40 pins of a Raspberry B+.

Print it, optionally laminate it, poke some holes in it and slip it over the GPIO pins of your Raspberry. Makes working with it much easier.

The Leaf shows the original Broadcom numbered GPIOs (green) as well the hardware independent pin numbers used by [WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/) (gray).

The repository contains the original Inkscape SVG as well as a DIN A4 PDF version for easy printing. Feel free to adjust it to your needs.
